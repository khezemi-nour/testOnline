### What you should do
You must solve all the problems located in the folder problems. They all come from the website https://www.hackerrank.com/ and you can easily test your solutions on this website. You are welcome to do whatever you want to achieve a beautiful and efficient result but you should use the submissions files in the folder submissions. You should just change the function under the comment "Complete the function below."

### How to do it
Do not hesitate to go to the Hackerrank site where the problems come from. It is necessary that ALL the test cases pass. Be careful to the constraints your code must not be too greedy in resources.
